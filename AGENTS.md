## Bunqueue

This project runs on Node.js and uses [bunqueue](https://bunqueue.dev) in server
mode. The standalone bunqueue server still requires Bun.

You can discover the CLI tool using `npm exec --no-install -p -- bunqueue --help`. The Nitro server plugin starts the standalone bunqueue server automatically.

Humans can explore the [dashboard](https://egeominotti.github.io/bunqueue-dashboard/docs/quickstart) running `npx bunqueue-dashboard`.
